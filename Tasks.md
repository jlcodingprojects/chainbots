# tasks for me

## readme
- Add AI usage statement

## Chainbots
- Tried magnetic joints and they dont work well. Will use fixed joints for verticies, try magnetic for edges
- Add chainbot cell internal components (FSM, Timer)
  -  FSM has 3 corners and 3 faces. Each can be set to ON or OFF (north or south effectively)

## Discovery
- Work on patterns the cells can follow to do stuff
- Do some exploration with chainbots linked together with random FSMs to see what emergent behavior arises

## Fun part
Write a 'home base' which calculates the set of states required to build an given structure and programs the chainbots to build it autonomously

## From there

- Make tech demo version (web friendly)
- Explore different options for chainbots
  - EG wheels, legs
  - Joint types
- Start looking at real world implementations
  - Magnetic joints?
  - Small motors?
  - Microcontrollers?
  - Power sources?
